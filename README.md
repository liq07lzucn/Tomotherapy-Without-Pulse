- html and latex folders contain code documentation, the first one as html format, and the second as pdf. We recommend that you look at the pdf documentation first.
- ResultTomo.py contains some tools to analyze the results
- OrganizedmultiToolIMRTtest.py contains the file that specializes into the creation of IMRT (FMO) plans. This capability is also incorporated into the multiTool.py file, and so it may be redundant.
